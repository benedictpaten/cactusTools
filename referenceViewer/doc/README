The reference viewer is a little prototype viewer for a net
meant which can be easily modified to run with any underlying
plotting framework. Here we use graphviz, but I think
we could use Zack Sanborns circos plots or Ted Goldstein could 
use this layout code for his browser.

The functions for the plotter interface in referenceViewer.h are 
implemented in graphViz.c, replacing this code should allow
a different plotting framework to be used.
